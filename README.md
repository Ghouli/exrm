# Elixir Release Manager

[![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/exrm.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/exrm)

The full documentation for Exrm is located [here](http://hexdocs.pm/exrm).

Thanks to @tylerflint for the original Makefile, rel.config, and runner script
which inspired this project!

**IMPORTANT: This project has been replaced by [Distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)**.

I am no longer maintaining this project - Distillery fully replaces it in every way, but does
require that you are on Elixir 1.3+.
